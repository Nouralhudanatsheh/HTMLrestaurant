    <h1>HISTORY OF THE BRAND</h1>
    <p>
      KFC, is a global chicken restaurant brand with a rich, decades-long
      history of success and innovation. It all started with one cook, Colonel
      Harland Sanders, who created a finger lickinâ€™ good recipe more than 80
      years ago, a list of secret herbs and spices scratched out on the back of
      the door to his kitchen. Today we still follow his formula for success,
      with real cooks breading and freshly preparing our delicious chicken by
      hand in more than 26,000 restaurants in over 150 countries and territories
      around the world.
